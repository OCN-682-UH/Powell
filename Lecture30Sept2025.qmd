## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
#| warning: false
```

If you put warning: false into your initial yaml then it'll be true for all of them (Nyssa does this usually for warnings and )

You can set your default for all your figure sizes etc as well

If you just do it in one code chunk it'll only do it for that file

Here are all the possible things you can do in this link from quarto:

## Introduction

I'm going to make my first *Quarto* document to be able to run some code about penguins yay

### Loading libraries

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
#library(beepr) #you can use this to ding when your code is done
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### Look at data

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

### Make a plot

Relationship between bill length and bill depth

```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm,bill_depth_mm,color = species)) +
  geom_point()
```
